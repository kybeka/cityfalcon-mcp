## Setup

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kybeka/cityfalcon-mcp.git
   cd cityfalcon-mcp
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment
   ```
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your API key — copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your CityFALCON API key:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, it can be accessed through any MCP client that can connect to its endpoint. Here are examples of how to use some of the functions:

### CityFalcon API Examples:
```python
# Example: Get financial news for Apple stock
result = await get_news_by_ticker_or_topic("AAPL")

# Example: Search for news about inflation
result = await get_news_by_ticker_or_topic("inflation")

# Example: Get sentiment data for stocks
result = await get_entity_sentiment("stocks", "d1")

# Example: Get analyst price targets
result = await get_analyst_price_targets("TSLA")
```

### DCSC API Examples:
```python
# Example: Get detailed portfolio analysis
result = await get_smart_portfolio("portfolio_123")

# Example: Get portfolio classification
result = await get_portfolio_classification("portfolio_123")

# Example: Get performance metrics with benchmark comparison
result = await get_portfolio_performance("portfolio_123", "benchmark_456")

# Example: Get sector breakdown
result = await get_portfolio_sectors("portfolio_123")
```

## Testing

The repository includes a comprehensive test suite in `tests.py` that tests all API endpoints. The test suite includes:

- Progress bar display of test completion
- Detailed logging of all API responses to log files
- Summary report of passed/failed tests

To run the tests:
```
python tests.py
```

Test results will be saved in the `logs` directory with timestamps for easy reference.
